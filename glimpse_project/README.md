In order to view the API you must have Django and Python environments installed on your terminal. Since we have not yet deployed the site
you must view it on a local server in order to test the web page.
For the registration page
  Make sure the user enters a real email address, and a device key that they will remember. They need both to sign in to their account later
  Logic has been installed making sure that a user cannot enter an invalid email, or the same email that has already been used.
  This is so the email address is unique and can be used as a username/sign in tool for the login page without running into errors.
For the login page
  Logic has been installed making it so you have to sign in with the correct email and device key number that you previously entered in at
  registration page. 
For the "GodMode" page
  The username is "Dylan Rose" and the password is "isourboss"
  This page is still incomplete but will eventually show information about each camera, battery life, images taken, videos taken, data used, etc.
  This page will also show a complete list of EVERY single image and video that has been taken, giving the admin in charge access to everything for testing purposes
